        <h3>Participation</h3>
        <p>
          Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this
          page, so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files
          are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as
          starting points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced
          tutorials and tips on working with CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML.
          This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way
          before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample
          files as a guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you
          have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit
          half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under your
          control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and all associated
          assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on
          our server.
        </p>
